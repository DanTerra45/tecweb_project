# API & JWL Test Project

## Project Initialization Steps

To set up this project, follow these instructions:

1. Create a Python virtual environment, learn how to create one [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) if you are unsure, place the `app.py` and `db.py` files inside your virtual environment (provided inside the `bd_web` folder).
2. Ensure that you have all the required libraries installed by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (provided inside the `bd_web` folder)
3. Within the virtual environment, start the Flask server with: `flask run` or if you're using a VSCode/VSCodium Python extension to run it directly.
4. In parallel on a new terminal, initiate the Angular project by following the next steps.

The project utilized an open-source (FOSS) named [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) to make sure the API works properly.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.10.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
